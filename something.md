This is Git telling you that there are no unrecorded, uncommitted changes present in this directory. Note that Git refers to versioned_dir as the “working directory”. This is an important piece of terminology. The “working directory” is the term we use to refer to a directory that is being version controlled.

This is really interesting stuff.
